 * Represents a discrete distribution that exists over the integer set 0 to
 * size()-1 A distribution consists of discrete events (x values) that have a
 * probability (returned by getProbability(y)) that each have an independent
 * probability. Independence means:
 * 
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li>only one event can happen.
 * 
 * <li>one event is guaranteed to happen.
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A side effect of this is that all probabilities in a distribution must add up
 * to 100% (one)
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to the probability of event x it also can be useful to look at
 * the Cumulative probability which is the probability that an event greater
 * than or equal to x occurs. This is returned by getCumulativeProbability(x)
 * 
 * <p>
 * All our implementations of Distribution are immutable and thus thread-safe
